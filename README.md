# Muse

## Description
Muse is a Discord bot that sends an embed containing information about a song's title, artist, and release country and date based the user inputted country and decade.  The idea of this bot is inspired by Radiooooo.com, which uses a similar method to determine songs to play.  In other words, it's like Radiooooo but as a music library bot.  Additionally, Muse keeps track of the most searched terms and recently liked songs among all servers.  It is built using Discord's and various other APIs that will be described in its usage in a later section of this ReadME. \
